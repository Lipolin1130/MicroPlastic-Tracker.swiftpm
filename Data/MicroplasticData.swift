let microbeads = MicroplasticInfo(
    name: .microbeads,
    imageName: "Microbeads",
    introduction: "Microbeads are tiny plastic spheres (less than 1mm) commonly found in personal care products like face scrubs and toothpaste. Due to their small size, they easily enter waterways and are ingested by plankton, starting the microplastic accumulation in the food chain."
)

let microfibers = MicroplasticInfo(
    name: .microfibers,
    imageName: "Microfibers",
    introduction: "Microfibers are thin plastic strands released from synthetic textiles (like polyester and nylon) during washing. These fibers are highly abundant in marine environments and are easily absorbed by filter feeders like shellfish, passing through the food chain."

let microfragments = MicroplasticInfo(
    name: .microfragments,
    imageName: "MicroFragments",
    introduction: "Microfragments are irregular plastic particles formed from the breakdown of larger plastic debris like bottles, bags, and fishing gear. They are commonly found in the ocean and are ingested by marine mammals, birds, and large fish."
